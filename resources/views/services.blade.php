                                        Where possible, we involve young people in the decision making process that affects
                                        the service we provide them. At each unit there are monthly meeting
                                        house where young people have an opportunity to make staff aware of their
                                        feelings, viewpoints and ideas. There is also a suggestion box where young
                                        people and staff can submit suggestions anonymously. Team meetings for the staff
                                        team take place on a monthly basis, and regular
                                        individual supervision sessions for each team member, giving staff the
                                        opportunity to voice their opinions and feedback to the Manager about the
                                        service being offered. Black Roses support will conduct annual appraisals for
                                        all staff and minimum quarterly feedbacks of young people using our services.
                                        Young people and those involved in their support are made aware of the
                                        serviceâ€™s complaints policy, and are encouraged to offer feedback through
                                        individual reviews and family/significant others forums.
                                        All staff undertakes regular training which includes a minimum of:
